# Non-Invasive Transabdominal Fetal Pulse Oximetry and Its Effect in Reduction of Caesarean Section Deliveries 
A research and development based medical project where the main goal is to reduce the ratio of Caesarean Section deliveres during childbirhs.

## DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH:

The data-driven approach comprises of training a machine learning model i.e. Logistic Regression to predict the mode of delivery (Caesarean Section or Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery) based on various real time pre-birth and post-birth medical parameters of the expecting mothers and their babies.

Build, train and fit a machine learning model that will predict the mode of delivery (Caesarean Section or Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery) during childbirth based on various pre-birth and post-birth parameters taken from the expectant mothers and her baby.

• Assess numerous machine learning models related to supervised learning to get an insight into each model to identify the most appropriate model i.e., Logistic Regression for the given problem. <br />
• Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to identify patterns, extract insights, test hypotheses, check assumptions and discover anomalies in the given data set. <br />
• Data preprocessing which encompasses imputing missing values, handling corrupted data and splitting the imported data set into training and test data sets. <br />
• Feature Selection on the data set by means of various statistical tests such as Fisher’s Exact Test for categorical variables and Student’s T-Test for continuous numeric variables. <br />
• Feature Engineering by means of implementing Principal Component Analysis as part of Dimensionality Reduction technique. This reduces the number of features/dimensionalities of the given data set, while minimizing information loss and retaining interpretability in the reduced data set. <br />
• Train Logistic Regression model using training data to predict whether a Cesarean-Section procedure should be performed on an expectant mother to deliver her baby. <br />
• Model validation and model evaluation of the logistic regression model based on different performance indicators and techniques. <br />
• Predicting mode of delivery using Logistic Regression model.<br />
